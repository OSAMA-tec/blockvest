Certainly! I'll guide you through the process of dockerizing your NestJS project step by step, including how to update the Docker image when you make changes.

Step 1: Create a Dockerfile

In the root of your project, create a file named `Dockerfile` with the following content:

```dockerfile
# Use the official Node.js 14 image as a parent image
FROM node:14

# Set the working directory
WORKDIR /usr/src/app

# Copy package.json and package-lock.json
COPY package*.json ./

# Install dependencies
RUN npm install

# Copy the rest of your app's source code
COPY . .

# Build your app
RUN npm run build

# Expose the port your app runs on
EXPOSE 3000

# Start the app
CMD ["npm", "run", "start:prod"]
```

Step 2: Create a .dockerignore file

Create a `.dockerignore` file in the root of your project to exclude unnecessary files:

```
node_modules
npm-debug.log
dist
```

Step 3: Build the Docker image

Open a terminal in your project root and run:

```bash
docker build -t my-nestjs-app .
```

This command builds a Docker image named `my-nestjs-app` based on your Dockerfile.

Step 4: Run the Docker container

After the build is complete, run your container:

```bash
docker run -p 3000:3000 my-nestjs-app
```

This command runs your app in a container and maps port 3000 of the container to port 3000 on your host machine.

Step 5: Stopping the container

To stop the running container, first find its ID:

```bash
docker ps
```

Then stop it using:

```bash
docker stop <container_id>
```

Updating the Docker image after changes:

When you make changes to your code, you need to rebuild the Docker image and run a new container. Here's the process:

1. Make your code changes.

2. Rebuild the Docker image:
   ```bash
   docker build -t my-nestjs-app .
   ```

3. Stop the old container if it's running:
   ```bash
   docker stop <container_id>
   ```

4. Run a new container with the updated image:
   ```bash
   docker run -p 3000:3000 my-nestjs-app
   ```

Additional tips:

1. Use Docker Compose: For more complex setups (e.g., when you need to run multiple services like your app and a database), consider using Docker Compose. Create a `docker-compose.yml` file in your project root:

```yaml
version: '3'
services:
  app:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    environment:
      - NODE_ENV=production
```

Then you can use:
- `docker-compose up --build` to build and start your services
- `docker-compose down` to stop them

2. Development mode: For development, you might want to use volume mounting to reflect code changes without rebuilding. Update your Dockerfile:

```dockerfile
...
CMD ["npm", "run", "start:dev"]
```

And run with:

```bash
docker run -p 3000:3000 -v $(pwd):/usr/src/app my-nestjs-app
```

This mounts your current directory to the container, allowing changes to be reflected immediately.

3. Environment variables: Make sure to pass your environment variables to the container. You can do this in the `docker run` command or in your `docker-compose.yml` file.

Remember to adjust the commands and configurations based on your specific project structure and requirements.



























i am working on one project in which tech stack i am using is MERN+BLOCKCHAIN+MACHINE LEARNING 
Project Detail:
basically i wana create a project on Realestate in which i want that if someone goes to realestate agent to buy some property then our model should show the results to customer that either your investment goes up or down in future or is this beneficall for you or not . or give him clear image that should he invest in this or not. this is machine learning part in which i will train a model in this .

and blockchain part is basically i want that if some have there property or anything like car or mobile etc
we convert this thing(car,property,mobile ) etc to token or nfts means this things only belong to his owner 
if someone try to check the details of someone asserts like if someone try to check mobile details like this mobile belong to whom then our system should show that this mobile belong to him or her 
basically we wana convert this into nfts
so i giving two options of payment one is digital currency and bother is cash then we will verify that this is ligit or not.
means user can  convert property into nft using digital currency and if not then have to pay using cash then we will verify by it self then we transfer nft to him.
and i will create app through which user will access these things
i hope you got my point so give me more detail more over view of project .

so give me more detail or things which i should add in this clear picture how this project is good in market and what you think what things i should add in this to make more perfect and best project
this is my basic idea so please tell me did you undertand this idea?
